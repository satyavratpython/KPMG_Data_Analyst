# KPMG_Data_Analyst Internship
*Task 1: Data Quality Assessment The project began with an evaluation of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s datasets on customer demographics, addresses, and transaction history. The goal was to explore the data, identify quality issues, and suggest improvements to enhance the company’s marketing strategy.

*Task 2: Customer Potential Analysis A new list of 1000 potential customers was analyzed using the existing datasets as a reference. The analysis aimed to identify high-value customers for targeted marketing efforts. A PowerPoint presentation was prepared to outline the approach for data exploration, model development, and interpretation, which included:

Understanding data distributions
Feature engineering
Data transformations
Modelling
Results interpretation and reporting
This plan was presented for client approval, detailing the strategic steps for each phase.

*Task 3: Dashboard Development An interactive dashboard was created to present key findings and analysis results. The dashboard, limited to three views/tabs, was designed to be visually engaging and informative, incorporating the client’s logo. It highlighted:

Trends in the data
Customer segments with the highest value
Proposed marketing and growth strategies
Recommendations on targeting the new 1000 customers and broader market segments
The dashboard also considered the integration of additional external datasets to gain deeper insights into customer preferences and purchasing propensities. The presentation aimed to provide a clear direction for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing initiatives.
